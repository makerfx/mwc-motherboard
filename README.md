# Magic Wheelchair Motherboard

The Magic Wheelchair Motherboard is a printed circuit board that makes it much easier to add interactivity to Magic Wheelchair builds (or other interactive projects). 

Features include:
* Plug-in support for Teensy 4.1 and the Teensy 4 audio shield
* 4 channels of non-blocking addressable LEDs (ws2812, neopixel, etc.) full compatible with FastLED
* Stereo sound input, processing and output including volume control, filters, polyphonic sound output, multiple channels of simultaneous sd-card playback, FFT and peak level analysis and much more.
* Level-shifted GPIO
* Full breakout of all Teensy pins
* .91" OLED Screen for debugging or status
* Multiple channels of high-current transistor driven output
* Selectable voltage (5v or 12v) for addressable LED outputs
* Pluggable connectors for VIN, LED outputs and high-current outputs
* Small prototyping area for adding additional components
* Expansion header for connecting to a daughterboard
* Support for USB host mode through the Teensy 4.1 USB header

## History
In 2019, [we build the Bumblebee Transformer Magic Wheelchair for Alex](https://makezine.com/2019/02/08/watch-these-makers-transform-a-wheelchair-into-an-interactive-bumblebee-costume/) - that project was completed in just a few weeks, and we used the Teensy 3.6 with the Teensy 3 Audio Shield. We hand soldered protoboards for the circuits including the Teensy components, level shifters and high-current transistor outputs. Alex loved Bumblebee and Magic Wheelchair builders provided very positive feedback on the interactivity of the build. Just two weeks later, we were asked to help provide the electronics for another MWC build in Portland. Again, we created a hand-soldered protoboard. We realized that if we could make this part easier with a plug & play board for interactive MWC builds, we could help the build community significantly.

We've now worked through 7 revisions of the board, including upgrading to the Teensy 4.1 and the Teensy 4 Audio shield. We've added more functionality, and made it easier than every to get started. All our MWC build code is Open Source and available here to get builders up-to-speed quickly.
