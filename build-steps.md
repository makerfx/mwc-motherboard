Bare PCB

Start with smallest components first

Power LEDs
VIN = Red
5V = Orange
3.3V = Green

LEDs are polarized
Small > in between pads indicates polarity; ground on the right
Some LEDs have arrow, others have Tee


Capacitor for level shifter

RvH= 4.7k
RvL= 1k

VRH = 1k
VCL = .1uf


Don't forget the bridge by the power LEDs


EROP-7SA-SE tweezers (mouser)

If ordering LEDs, get 0805 for ease of soldering
